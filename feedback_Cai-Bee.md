# Responds to formative feedback

> _What I have done to address formative feedback_

## Practical4:
- Modify the content of [my git hub website](https://cai-bee.github.io/). Briefly introduce myself on the website.
- In the file _thingsIlike.txt_, I change things I like from numbers (1,2,3...) to real things.
- Add reflection to the file _Reflection.txt_
- For **commit message**, I try to make them more informative when committing.

## Practical5:
- In the file _variables.py_, I used loops to show W == Z for all 4 combinations of X and Y (TRUE/FALSE) and print them.
- In the file _mystery_code_, I added a commented line about the function of this code(which I forgot to write it before).
- Correct the code in r_rate.
> After each turn of infection, the total number of infections becomes r times the previous number

## Practical6:
- Change documents into python files by adding '.py' postfix.
- Add label to the pie chart of _Coronavirus.py_.
- Present a sorted list of average exon length numerically using `list.sort()` function.
- In the file of _manipulation.py_, I deleted several useless commend lines to avoid returning errors.
- Made codes drawing box plot more organized.
