### Summary

## record of the alignment score and the percentage of identical amino acids for each comparison:

# For alignment between SOD2_human (NP_000627.2) and RandomSeq:
# The percentage of identical animo acids is 5.41%.
# alignment score of BLOSUM62 is -0.83

# For alignment between SOD2_mouse (NP_038699.2) and RandomSeq:
# The percentage of identical animo acids is 5.86%.
# alignment score of BLOSUM62 is -0.81

# For alignment between SOD2_human (NP_000627.2) and SOD2_mouse (NP_038699.2):
# The percentage of identical animo acids is 89.64%.
# alignment score of BLOSUM62 is 9.82

## interpretation:

# I found that the SOD2 protein sequences of human and mouse are very similar comparing to random sequence.
# The percentage of identical animo acids is 89.64%, which is far higher than 5.41% and 5.86% of alignment with random sequence.
# The alignment scores between human and mouse sequence (9.82) is also significantly high.
# These findings indicate that the SOD2 protein is evolutionarily conserved.
# Human and mouse might have a same origin, and further suggests that human and mouse come from the same ancestral species.
