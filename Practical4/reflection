4.19 supplemental reflection
As I forgot to write something in this file, I am now going to write some reflection about the IBI course in this semester.
The IBI course is quite interesting, however there were also many difficulties.
I found it challenging to remember many codes or commands.
The intenal connection of github is sometimes confusing.
