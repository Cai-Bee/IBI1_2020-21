Question: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?

line number: 76-90

Discussion
There was no case in Spain before 2020-2-29
The numbers of new cases in Spain were small at the beginning.
After around 2020-03-08 it began to increase rapidly.
The total cases increased exponentially after the first few cases emerged.
The increasing rate went down between 2020-3-26 and 2020-3-31, which suggests the situation there might have been already controlled.
